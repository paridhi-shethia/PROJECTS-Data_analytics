# Python Data Analysis Project – Sales Data

## Overview
This project is a basic Python-based data analysis performed on a sales dataset.
The goal of the project is to understand sales patterns, category performance,
top products, and regional trends using simple and commonly used Python libraries.

The analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook using an Excel dataset.

## Dataset
- Format: Excel (`.xlsx`)
- Contains information related to sales such as:
  - Order Date
  - Sales
  - Category
  - Product Name
  - Region  
  (column names may vary slightly based on the dataset)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I Did in This Project
- Loaded an Excel dataset using pandas
- Checked the structure and basic information of the data
- Cleaned the data by handling duplicates and missing values
- Converted date columns into a usable format
- Performed basic analysis such as:
  - Total sales calculation
  - Category-wise sales analysis
  - Monthly sales trends
  - Top-selling products
  - Region-wise sales comparison
- Visualized results using simple charts

## Key Observations
- Some product categories contribute significantly more to total sales
- Sales show variation across different months
- A small number of products generate a large share of revenue
- Certain regions perform better than others in terms of sales

## Project Files
- `Sales_Data_Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- `sales_data.xlsx` – Dataset used for analysis

## Conclusion
This project helped me practice data analysis using Python and understand how
basic operations like grouping, aggregations, and visualizations can be used to
extract useful insights from real-world data.
